                            Finger gun (solo project) is a machine learning game in which the player 
                            uses their hands to aim at the enemies that are approaching the player. 
                            The game uses three different software: Unity, Processing and Wekinator. 
                            Wekinator communicates with Processing that handles the features of a hand 
                            skeleton (input) and Unity which handles the game (output) and grabs the 
                            hand mechanic features from Processing. The languages that this project 
                            uses were Java, JavaScript and C#.
                        </p>

                        <p class="para-font">
                            The design for this project was done via Unity's objects. The enemy was created 
                            using 5 sphere objects, one for the body, one as the ring, one for the eyeball 
                            and two for the eye shape; the textures for the game done on Photoshop and 
                            exported as a png to the 'Texture' file. The leap motion hand models were 
                            assets taken from the leap motion sdk. 
                            <br>
                            The level design was created using Unityâ€™s terrain tool that allows the user 
                            to create quick and simple assets such as mountains, trees and more. Created 
                            mountains and painted which grabs textures that were simply implemented from Photoshop.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="subtitle-font">IMPLIMENTATION</h2>
                        <p class="para-font">
                            The implementation for the project had a varies software and hardware that 
                            were used to create this project. The hardware needed for it was a leap motion 
                            to detect hand gestures; as for the software needed they were, Wekinator which 
                            records the features from Processing that the user sets (using the kNN algorithm), 
                            then runs the features to Unity, this works by having a oscillator that can 
                            communicate with the software that have the same signal.
