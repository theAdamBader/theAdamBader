                            Fly Away (solo project) is a 2D shoot ‘em game where you enter 
                            the battle, fighting a swarm of enemies that represents our inner thought and doubts 
                            in which you (the player) have to shoot them to clear the way of your conscious. 
                            This project was created using openFrameworks (Visual Studio) and C++. 
                        </p>
                    
                        <h1 class="title-font">DESIGN & IMPLIMENTATION</h1>
                        
                        <h2 class="subtitle-font">DESIGN</h2>
                        <p class="para-font">
                            The design of the character was created using Adobe Illustrator as it dealt 
                            with vectors rather than pixels and created a static image of the character 
                            and enemy, which the enemy is a horizontal flipped with a different colour and 
                            corrupted wings which represents the corruption that enters one’s cognitive. 
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="subtitle-font">IMPLIMENTATION</h2>
                        <p class="para-font">
                                The implementation of the game is near to its core mechanics. There are 
                                the basics aspects of it, which are the character’s movement, collision, 
                                health and a firing system. These are inherited from an entity script which 
                                allows other cpp files to inherit its property then manipulate its variable depending 
                                on what trait each class should inherit from its parent and the entity script 
                                inherits its variables from an abstract class (inGameObjects.h).
