               <h3>What is the game?</h3>
               
               <p> Run Forest Run is a scrolling game in which you play as Forest Grump, a tree that is running from a forest fire. The objective is see how far you can get before the fire spirites get you. Can you help Forest run as fast as you can or will the fire get him and itis over.</p>
   
               <h3>Why create this game?</h3>
   
               <p>The reason to why I took a different direction is because unlike other scrolling games where you see how fast you can get, I also used the movie reference Forrest Gump to create a sweet and playful game; however there is a subliminal message to it too that no matter how far you run, the fire will catch up and burn the forest. No matter how far that poor tree runs, the fire would eventually get poor Forest Grump.</p>
