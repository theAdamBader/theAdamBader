	<p class="paragraph">The first project was creating a website using WordPress in which I took the leadership role and decided on what roles everyone would take and how we could able to create a site that would not be too complicated as we were just novices when it came to WordPress. However, I made sure that the team produced the work needed so the we can merge our work and when one member failed to fulfil their role due to lack of communication I took their role to ensure to have a site running before the deadline. The link to the site is: <a href="http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~abade011/abade011_wordpress/">http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~abade011/abade011_wordpress</a></p>

	<h3 class="subheading" id="GM">Introduction to Game Development: Project</h3>
	<p class="paragraph">Our project for Game Development was creating a game with a space theme using Unity.</p>
	<p class="paragraph">How the idea of Alienated came about was when the team and myself discussed what our game should be about and so our Project Manager (Danny San) came up with the title and as I was in charge on the player and enemy design so I came up for the storyline for the game which is, an alien who has been alienated by his race has made him go on a rampage and so your objective is to kill your own race. It is a dark story with no happy endings</p>
	<p class="paragraph">In terms of coding, I was assigned to animate and move both the player and enemy as well as AI dectection, the other team member was in charge of the platforms, and level design as for our project manager he was in charge of collision detection and the health system as well as ensuring that everyone had done the work tailored to his needs. You may download the game from Google Drive: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw1TKNqKUCReN2NXLVdYRkZuVG8/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw1TKNqKUCReN2NXLVdYRkZuVG8/view</a></p>
