	<h3 class="subheading" id="DM">Introduction to Digital Media: Projects</h3>
	<p class="paragraph">The first project was creating a website using WordPress in which I took the leadership role and decided on what roles everyone would take and how we could able to create a site that would not be too complicated as we were just novices when it came to WordPress. However, I made sure that the team produced the work needed so the we can merge our work and when one member failed to fulfil their role due to lack of communication I took their role to ensure to have a site running before the deadline. The link to the site is: <a href="http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~abade011/abade011_wordpress/">http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~abade011/abade011_wordpress</a></p>

	<h3 class="subheading" id="GM">Introduction to Game Development: Project</h3>
	<p class="paragraph">Our project for Game Development was creating a game with a space theme using Unity.</p>
	<p class="paragraph">How the idea of Alienated came about was when the team and myself discussed what our game should be about and so our Project Manager (Danny San) came up with the title and as I was in charge on the player and enemy design so I came up for the storyline for the game which is, an alien who has been alienated by his race has made him go on a rampage and so your objective is to kill your own race. It is a dark story with no happy endings</p>
	<p class="paragraph">In terms of coding, I was assigned to animate and move both the player and enemy as well as AI dectection, the other team member was in charge of the platforms, and level design as for our project manager he was in charge of collision detection and the health system as well as ensuring that everyone had done the work tailored to his needs. You may download the game from Google Drive: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw1TKNqKUCReN2NXLVdYRkZuVG8/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw1TKNqKUCReN2NXLVdYRkZuVG8/view</a></p>

	<h3 class="subheading" id="IP">Introduction to Programming: Project</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">In Introduction to Programming we had to use Proccessing in order to do our final project of the year, using Java language. In my "final" project I created a simple platform game called Run Forest Run where your main objective, as Forest Grump, is to run as fast as you can from a forest fire and see how far you can go!</p>

    <p class="paragraph">This was an indivual task so that allowed me to explore my creative side and create a game that would be simple to play. Game is available on GitHub</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">2nd Year Projects</h2>
    <h3 class="subheading" id="GM2">Game Development</h3> 
    <p class="paragraph">For the second year, we had another group project. In which there were no theme and we were allowed to use an game engine we desired.</p>

    <p class="paragraph"> Our project is a top tile turn-base RPG. It was a two-man job, with Alice Casey being the project manager and me being the Lead Design and Lead QA.<br> This added perssure to us as we first started as a team of four but unfortunately two dropped out (after Christmas) from the course due to personal circumstances</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Even so, Alice and I managed to create the core machanics for our game. This was complished using Game Maker Studio</p>

    <h3 class="subheading" id="CPP">C++</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">For the second year, we've studied C++ using Open Frame Works in which for 2nd term work, we had to create a project in which I, since it was an individual project, created a simple shoot 'em up game called Fly Away. It is available on GitHub.</p>
