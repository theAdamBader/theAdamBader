                        <p class="para-font">
                            La Vie est Belle (solo project) is a mobile virtual reality therapy (VRT) 
                            game where the player must enter the cottage by completing two puzzles set 
                            in a different dimension which the player can access through by a teleport. 
                            The game features two out of the three illusions, the first is a place illusion 
                            (PI) so that it could track the player’s head tracking, giving them 6 degrees of 
                            freedom and the second is a plausible (Psi) illusion which transports the into a 
                            place that they can be immersed in. <br>
                            The game requires an Android phone, Samsung Gear VR and a Gear VR controller in as 
                            it is an immersive game. The reason La Vie est Belle was my final year project is 
                            because there are not many VRT games that tackle anxiety and depression and so the 
                            participants that were involved, while they were random, they were also selective as 
                            the needed to play the game a couple of times to ensure that the game did make them feel 
                            an ease during and after the game as some suffered from stress, anxiety and other disabilities.  
                        </p>
                    
                        <h1 class="title-font">DESIGN & IMPLIMENTATION</h1>
                        
                        <h2 class="subtitle-font">DESIGN</h2>
                        <p class="para-font">
                            The game design involved using MDA, so had to focus on the mechanics of the game and its interaction 
                            with the objects and then the dynamics of what each input (Gear VR controller) would do as the player 
                            pressed the button. After focusing on how the mechanics and dynamics would formulate, then the next focus was 
                            the aesthetics of the game, which a low poly asset would be interesting as the aim is to transport the player 
                            into a fantasy and immersive world.  <br>
                            The level design as mentioned is a low poly game that allows the player to explore and interact with the objects. 
                            The assets were created using Blender as the project needed its own assets to go with the game’s aesthetics 
                            and, the textures for the objects where created from Adobe Photoshop as the colour scheme for the game’s 
                            environment needed to give a vibrant and calming atmosphere. 
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="subtitle-font">IMPLIMENTATION</h2>
                        <p class="para-font">
                            The implementation involving this project included OVR SDK package with changes to the input script so that 
                            it matches the Gear VR controller’s inputs as well as adding a raycaster to aim at the objects, depending on the 
                            distance.  For movement implementing a Virtual Navigation works better than other navigation types as 
                            it would allow players to explore the field. <br>
                            In Unity, a shader script was implemented to the teleporters to give the aesthetics of looking through 
                            the other side and so the material would move depending on the distance and rotation of the player 
                            before entering the level. To ensure that the player could not get through the back of the teleport, a 
                            Euler function was added as it would allow the player only to enter from the front and not the back of 
                            the teleporter.
