            <h3>What is the game about?</h3>
              
            <p> It is a mobile Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT) game that would help stimulate and reduce stress and anxiety levels and depression. Creating a VR puzzle game that would have a plausibility and a place illusion implemented that would able to allow the player be transported into a virtual world that is not like the real world.</p>
            

            <h3>Why create this game?</h3>
            <p>There are not many VRT games on mobile that helps to destress or reduce anxiety and depression. So, being able to create a plausible game would be the achievement.</p>

    <div class="textCenter">
            <h3>Unity</h3>
            <p>The game engine that was used was Unity, which allowed myself to create three scenes, completeGame, mainMenu, and credits. Also, it allows to hold files such as: materials, textures, scripts, prefabs, scripts, plugins, shaders and etc. </p>
            <p>By default Unity measures in metres and to ensure that level is done correctly, I made that main player be at 1.78m in the y axis so that it has an average height and then adding the prefabs was easy as it would ensure that the player’s view was accurate and that players would not feel as if they are small while the environment was high and visa versa.</p>

            <h3>Blender</h3>
            <p>Using Blender, I was able to design low polygon assets that would suit the niche of the game which were exported as a .fbx into Unity's prefab file. Low poly designs were simple to create as it gave the oppportunity to create original assets for the game's aesthetics.</p>

            <h3>Photoshop</h3>
            <p>It was used to create the textures for each material needed in Unity. Reason it was used as it allows the create the textures that the developer desires to design for their material and so I needed to use it to create materials for the project as there was a specific colour scheme that I needed to give the game a vibrant and calming environment.</p>

        <div class="textCenter">
            <h3>Gears</h3>
            <p>The hardware used for the project were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="bulletPoint">Samsung Gear VR</li>
                <li class="bulletPoint">Gear VR controller</li>
                <li class="bulletPoint">Samsung Galaxy S7</li>
            </ul>

<br>

            <p>In order to build into an Android phone, I opened the command prompt and typed ‘adb devices’ which would find a unique signature file for the device and then I copied that serial number onto the Oculus signature file generator (osig) which provided a file that was placed into ‘Plugins/Andriod/assets/oculussig_9885e6325a42544d5a’ and that would allow to compile the game into the mobile.</p>

            <h3>Three Illusions</h3>
            <p>For the design I focused on the place illusion (head tracking) and plausiblity illusion to try and create a virtual world that would transport the player and give the illusion of a real place that they can be immersed in. However, I did not implement an embodiment illusion as the task is to change the player's cognition and be able to enjoy and relax in the environment they are in.</p>
         
            <h3>Level Design</h3>
            <p>The game has two puzzles in which the player would walk into a portal, teleporting the player onto the puzzle. The first puzzle is a muscial puzzle in which the player presses the play button in which then the player would have to recreate the sound they hear onto the musical tree; the second puzzle is a maze in which players would have to memorise 4 numbers to reach the end of the door and input the four digits the have memorised, that would slide the door open and from there they can enter the house and interact with the image that would end the demo.</p>

        <div class="textCenter">
            <h3>Code</h3>
            <p>The code that were implemented were the interactions for the game and its moevement, the movement for the Gear VR controller was done by implemented by having the trigger button being the movement and the turning was by the controllers center point, giving the players a 6 degree of freedom and the touchpad was allowing players to interact with the objects.</p>
         
            <h3>Oculus Package & VR Samples</h3>
            <p>To be able to create a VR game for the Oculus, Samsung Gear VR, I downloaded the OVR SDK package that allowed to get the mapping for the controllers and the gear VR's player and controller prefabs and using the VR samples I was able to modify the eye raycaster script and input scripts to allow the interaction to happen between the player and object.</p>
