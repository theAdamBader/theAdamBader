            <h3>What is the game?</h3>

            <p> The game that we are working on is Alienated. It is an action platform game where the main protagonist is a villain. You play as the alien, Gon, whom is being alienated by his own race. They are known as the Hebi clan which are a race to serpents with special abilities. They are a powerful race. However, Gon has not manifested his abilities due to his lack of bloodlust. </p>
            <p>When Gon felt left behind and looked down upon, his angry took over and killed a member of his race and that is when he decided to teach his own race a lesson of what it means to be abused and thus his ability manifested.</p>

            <h3>Why create this game?</h3>

            <p>The reason to why we took a different direction is because unlike platform games where it is to save a princess or significant  other from a villain such as Mario, Super Meat Boy or to save world such Super Metroid. Our game goes into a more darker side where you play as the antagonist and see how such an innocent alien becomes a psychopath due to being bullied and isolation hence the game name “Alienated”.</p>

        <h3>Character Design</h3>

        <p>The characters were created using Adobe Illustrator by myself as the storyline concept was thoughtout by myself, and so needed to create a unique alien that was alienated by his race and goes on a rampage whilst the level design was being handled by my team mate.</p>

        <p>The main character, named Gon, has a laser gun which his arms would change weapons variant to which level they are in and the enemies each have a unique attack, the red snake which is a melee attack and the galaxy snake which is a long range character.</p>

        <h3>Level Design</h3>

        <p>The level design was meant to have a 16 bit dark theme; however, the level designed by my team was light whilst the boss level was grim. However, I mentioned that as it is level one, it would start light and head into a more grim level as the player progresses.</p>

        <img src="./img/portfolio/Alienated/code.png" style="width:50%; height:50%;" class="imgWrapLeft" alt="Main character's movement script">

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>

        <p>You are able to control one character which is the main character, as the main character you are able to walk, jump, double jump and shoot. You will have 5 health to complete the game and rack up as many points as possible, there will be various checkpoints in the game with a boss at the end to give high points. Points can be used as a measurement of the player’s skill level playing platform games. The map has been pre-made so everything has a purpose in the game, from the moving platforms to the bouncy platforms. There are three enemies in the game: </p>

        <ul>
            <li class="bulletPoint">Melee enemy</li>
            <li class="bulletPoint">Ranged enemy</li>
            <li class="bulletPoint">The boss</li>
        </ul>

<br>

        <h3>Code</h3>

        <p>The codes implemented are the player's movement, health and the shooting range and enemies' movement, collision, health pickup and many more.</p>
        <p>The code was split by three people with myself movement script and AI detection whilst my team mate took charge of varies of code.</p>

            <h3>Adam Bader</h3>
            <p>I was tasked with creating the enemies and the antagonist as well as having enemy AI detection for when the player is near by and adding the movements for the main character.</p>
         
            <h3>Daniel San</h3>
            <p>Daniel was tasked with the weapon, health and firing system as well as ensuring that the collisions work and further more added the scene to the boss fight.</p>
         
            <h3>Gregory Burton</h3>
            <p>Gregory was tasked with adding audio (using <a href="freesound.org">freesound.org</a>) and level designs to match the character's design as he was confident in his art skills.</p>
