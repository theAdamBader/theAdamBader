              <h1 id="overview">Game Overview </h1>
              <h3>What is the game?</h3>
                 <p> The game that we are working on is Alienated. It is an action platform game where the main protagonist is a villain. You play as the alien, Gon, whom is being alienated by his own race. They are known as the Hebi clan which are a race to serpents with special abilities. They are a powerful race. However, Gon has not manifested his abilities due to his lack of bloodlust. </p>
                <p>When Gon felt left behind and looked down upon, his angry took over and killed a member of his race and that is when he decided to teach his own race a lesson of what it means to be abused and thus his ability manifested.</p>

            <h3>Why create this game?</h3>
            <p>The reason to why we took a different direction is because unlike platform games where it is to save a princess or significant  other from a villain such as Mario, Super Meat Boy or to save world such Super Metroid. Our game goes into a more darker side where you play as the antagonist and see how such an innocent alien becomes a psychopath due to being bullied and isolation hence the game name “Alienated”.</p>

              <h1 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h1>
              <p>You are able to control one character which is the main character, as the main character you are able to walk, jump, double jump and shoot. You will have 5 health to complete the game and rack up as many points as possible, there will be various checkpoints in the game with a boss at the end to give high points. Points can be used as a measurement of the player’s skill level playing platform games. The map has been pre-made so everything has a purpose in the game, from the moving platforms to the bouncy platforms. There are three enemies in the game - a melee enemy, a ranged enemy and the boss. </p>
