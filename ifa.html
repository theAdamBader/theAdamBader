            <h3>What is the game?</h3>
            
            <p>Invasion Force Alpha depicts the story of small group of alien mercenaries, performing the roles of scouting for their home planet, Penumbra. The goal is to covertly set up base of operations in planet Earth using the Alpha task force. They are a small group of units that can gather intel and destroy unnecessary objects. The result of the player’s consequences may affect the story depending on the actions they take, whether being able to complete the level unseen or destroy their enemy and gather intel.</p>

            <h3>Why create this game?</h3>

            <p>Invasion Alpha Force is a tile turn based strategy game where the player takes control of each unit vs AI units in a militant map environment. It takes place in a grid map with range and melee units having a limited tile movement where the player must strategize carefully as once place on a tile, they are not allowed to move until the next turn in which then the CPUs take turn to manoeuvre and possibly attack which would injury or kill the player’s unit.</p>

    <div class="textCenter1">
            <h3>Character Design</h3>

            <p>The character sprites where created by myself using Aseprite which allows for great pixel art. Using that I was able to create each character frame by frame and tag which frames handle movement, attack and deaths. After that, I would export each frame as a .png file as Aseprite as an inbuilt spirte cutter.</p>

            <h3>Level Design</h3>

            <p>Level design was handled by my team mate, whom created a field, which fit the objective well as the first level was set as being able to defeat certain enemies within allocated turns before reinforcement arrives.</p>

    <h1 id="implementation" class="title">IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
        <hr>

        <img src="./img/portfolio/Invasion/code.png" style="width:50%; height:50%;" class="imgWrapLeft" alt="Main level">

        <div class="textCenter">

            <h3>Gameplay</h3>

            <p>The gameplay is near at its core mechanics. There are at basics aspects of a RPG where one can move the characters around the map and where the range character can attack incoming enemies at its sight. There were certain aspects we hoped to get working such as the AI system where enemies can detect and attack the players and vice versa. We could not get the turn based to work however, one can press the R button to refresh and see how the allies move around the map.</p>

            <h3>Code</h3>

            <p>The language used was GameMaker's inbuilt language. Which allowed to create the team to create the room which is the level, add the sprites and their actions and creating enemy movement too.</p>

            <p>The scripts were created in their own unique way where the objects had their own scripts which were the unit's states and movement whilst the scripts folder handled the fields (level) data structure, spawn points and the attack.</p>
