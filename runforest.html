							<h1 class="title-font">OVERVIEW</h1>
						
							<p class="para-font">Run Forest Run (solo project) is a scrolling game in which you play as Forest Grump, a tree, 
								that is running from a forest fire. The objective is to continue to run as far as you (the player) 
								can go and see if you can beat the high score before the fire catches you. 
								This was created using Processing (Java) and Adobe Illustrator.
							</p>
						
							<h1 class="title-font">DESIGN & IMPLIMENTATION</h1>
							
							<h2 class="subtitle-font">DESIGN</h2>
							<p class="para-font">
								The characters were designed using Adobe Illustrator as Illustrator deals with 
								vectors and not pixels. The main character was drawn as a sprite sheet with different facial reactions and movement; as for the enemies they had a simple 
								design with three to four frames for movement as they did not have any 
								functionality other than for the player to avoid them. <br>
								The level design was designed as a static image with the intention for it 
								to loop infinite times throughout the duration of the game. 

							</p>

							<h2 class="subtitle-font">IMPLIMENTATION</h2>
							<p class="para-font">The software that was used to run this project was 
								Processing in which each class had its own class that dealt with the player’s 
								functionality, the enemies’ movement, collision and background movement and have 
								the main class initialise the functionalities from the other classes.
								The game adheres a simple 2D character functions which is to press left and right
								 and jump using the space button; the background image used in the game is a 
								 static image that loops throughout the duration of the game and the appearance of 
								 the enemies appears depending how far the player reaches.
