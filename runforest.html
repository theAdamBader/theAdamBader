              <h1 id="overview">Game Overview </h1>
              <h3>What is the game?</h3>
                 <p> Run Forest Run is a scrolling game in which you play as Forest Grump, a tree that is running from a forest fire. The objective is see how far you can get before the fire spirites get you. Can you help forest runs as fast as you can or will the fire get you and it's game over.</p>

            <h3>Why create this game?</h3>
            <p>The reason to why I took a different direction is because unlike other scrolling games where you see how fast you can get, I also used the movie reference Forrest Gump to create is sweet and playful game; however there is a subliminal message to it too that no matter how far you run, the fire will catch up and burn the forest. Not only did I take the quote "Run Forrest Run" and turned it into a game about you running from a forest fire but it is also to make the player aware about forest fires and no matter how far that poor tree ran, the fire would eventually get poor Forest Grump.</p>

              <h1 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h1>
              <p>You are able to control one character which is the main character, as the main character you are able to walk, jump, and avoid enemies heading towards you and the forest fire behind you, there are four types of enemies, small fire ball, and large fire ball which comes at a slow pace, a blue fire from a above, incase you jump high and a small green fire that heads towards you very fast. The score is tallied by how far you can reach the point and keeps a highscore to encourage others to best the last person's highscore.</p>

            <h1 id="contribution">Contributions</h1>
            <h3>Player, Enemies, Stage & Audio</h3>
            <p>I drew the player using Adobe Illustrator as the game had a more finer detail so ensured I used Vectors for this game rather than pixels</p>
         
            <p>The enemies were also created using Adobe Illustrator with a more simplist design as they could be resized, change of colour and used again but with a different behaviour from each other</p>
         
            <p>The level was a simple a design which looped each time making it look like it is a stretch canvas and for the audio I used <a href="freesound.org">freesound.org</a> to download the tracks and use it on the game</p>
